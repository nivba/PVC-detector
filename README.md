# PVC-ditector
Premature ventricular contraction detection tool, Created for the benefit of a course project at Ben Gurion University.
PVC detection, using KNN applied to features extracted from one-lead ECG Signal.

you can run the project easily from 'main.m' file with MATLAB 2020. Note that the database and program folders should have the same path.

Graphs are avirable  
Steps: 
1) preprocessing.
2) bit detection (QRS detection).
3) features extraction.
4) features selection.
5) 2 class bit classification (pvc and non-pvc).

DATA-BASE:
10 ECG recordings drawn from MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database: https://www.physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/
