# PVC-ditector
Premature ventricular contraction detection tool, Created for the benefit of a course project at Ben Gurion University.
PVC detection, using KNN applied to features extracted from one-lead ECG Signal.

Steps: 
1) preprocessing.
2) bit detection (QRS detection).
3) features extraction.
4) features selection.
5) 2 class bit classification (pvc and non-pvc).

DATA-BASE:
10 ECG recordings drawn from MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database: https://www.physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/
